## Build for production

Require `node`, and `grunt`. Run

    npm install
    grunt

and find the app on `production`.

Note that until [grunt-usemin#138](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin/issues/138) is resolved you would need to manually add `defer` attribute to the `<script>` tags generated by it.
